# 📊 Stack-Overflow-Developer-Survey-Python-Pandas

This project is dedicated to the practical application of the Pandas library for analyzing large datasets. The main goal is to study patterns in data through the prism of descriptive statistics and deep aggregation.

## Project goals
* Optimization of loading and manipulation of large amounts of information.
* Calculation of measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and analysis of percentage distributions.
* Detection and handling of missing values ​​(NaN), working with sets and duplicates.
* Filtering data by various criteria.
* Grouping data and calculating aggregate metrics.
* Working with sets for data intersection and filtering.
* Structuring results into convenient tabular formats for further interpretation.

# Project implementation stages
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Colab

* The main dataset was loaded and the number of unique records (respondents) was counted via the .shape attribute.
* The dataset was filtered based on the intersection of columns of two tables.
* Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) were calculated.
* Data filtering functions applied.
